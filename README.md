# AI and ML algorithms in IoT Applications

## Overview

Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) can provide timely intervention which can significantly increase the lifetime and operational efficiency of high valued assets typically seen in IoT applications.  SAS Analytics for IoT provides meaningful analytics on vast amount of data generated across supply chains to derive value from the data and add analytical maturity. 
It supports multi-phase analytics for detecting deterioration or abnormal behavior in assets that generate high-frequency, high-dimensional data. It gives us flexibility to support a variety of offline models and deploy it in-stream for real-time scoring. In addition to offline model deployment it provides in-stream analytics execution on streams of events. 

Key take-aways:
*  Learn how to use high-frequency algorithms such as Subspace Tracking, Robust Principal Component Analysis, etc.
*  Learn best practices and applications of high-frequency algorithms
